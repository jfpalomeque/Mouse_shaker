# Mouse shaker

During this new times of remote work, I was looking a way to avoid my computer to go to sleep and close the remote
connection during my 1h lunch break.

This is a quite simple script that asks the user for how many minutes it needs to run, and just shake
the mouse cursor every 20 seconds.

Nothing more, nothing else.
